The smallest p-value here is associated with zn. The negative coefficient
for this predictor suggests that if there had been a crime yesterday, then it is less likely that there will be a crime today. However, at a value of 0.017, the p-value
is still relatively small, and so there is clear evidence of a real association
between zn and crimes.
